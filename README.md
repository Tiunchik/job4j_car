# job4j_car - The learning task to work with spring. Developing a spring application that looks like a simple copy of the police accident database.
# I used the following modules: Spring Boot(+ security, data(hibernate), web, thymeleaf, test), PostgreSQL, Liquebase (create all database on the first start and fill in data about admin), JUnit (for controllers testing), HTML (bootstrap4).
# I didn't use js and try to create productive front-end only with thymeleaf dialect. Container - Tomcat. There aren't any XML, only Java config and application.properties for spring config.
# There is three-tier architecture is used in the project (presentation, business, and data access layers)
# Link on heroku deploying - https://polise-department-database.herokuapp.com/ (login/pass - admin)
